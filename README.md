# Introduction

This is **Re:Hubble**, our entry in the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2018](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org).

Our entry is in the category [On the Shoulders of Giants](https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/universe-beauty-and-wonder/shoulders-giants/details)

The challenge is to "Create a game using images from the Hubble Space Telescope as integral components!"

# Backstory

\<Zachary write the premise here>

# Usage

The game is setup as a github web page, head over to https://pastcompute.github.io/re-hubble and play!

# License

The underlying game engine, [Dedalus](https://github.com/pistacchio/Dedalus) is GPL licensed so therefore our game is also GPL licensed.
